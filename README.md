# Unmaintained project!

I might take another stab at this, but at the moment I no longer plan on developing this.

# Rust Experiments
This is only some really basic stuff to teach me the basics of rust. The code
might be the worst you've ever seen, but if that's the case, please don't look
at my other repos.

## brainfuck

This is a brainfuck interpreter that's quite complex in the sense that I decided
to create a lexer to split the program into tokens. This is completely useless
for brainfuck as a character is a token, however I wanted to see how the `match`
keyword from Rust could be used to create a lexer.
